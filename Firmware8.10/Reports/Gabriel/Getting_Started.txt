1) Connect BBG via USB cable - wait for reboot
2) go to http://beagleboard.org/static/beaglebone/latest/README.htm You should see a list of the most recent drivers.
   Install the one for your operating system. Note that on Windows it may fail due to lack of signature. Search the web how to disable signature requirement for Windows.
3) Use PuttY or something to SSH into the BBG by connecting to 192.168.7.2 (port 22)
3) Connect the BBG to the Internet via the USB:
	- BBG: type sudo /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1 
	- On Windows, go to adapter settings -> and enable sharing of your network connection with "Linux USB Ethernet/RNDIS"
	- On Windows, in adapter settings -> edit the "Linux USB Ethernet/RNDIS" connection: set IP 192.168.7.1 / 255.255.255.0 and DNS server to 8.8.8.8
4) once connected to the internet (ping google.com to test), do (BBG): 
	- sudo apt-get update
	- sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
